# Installation:
Currently, this package has not been uploaded on PyPi. The easiest way to install is by cloning this repository with `git clone https://github.com/VideoCarp/terminal_easy.git` into your project.
After that, take the files out of `src` and move them up to the same level as your main file. You can also download the repository via other means.

Why?  
Because it's not ready to be published. It's far too small.
